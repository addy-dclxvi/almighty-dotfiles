## Introduction
A collection of configs to be placed in the users home directory usually prefixed with a period, hence the name dotfiles.
This repo is actually intended for my personal backup, but everyone are welcome to use these resources. 
Maybe not always up to date with my current setup.
I also put some explanations in this README file, because people say they are interested with my setup. I hope this will be useful.
Also, please read what written inside the files before use. And remember, copying configuration file doesn't make it instantly work :wink: <br />

## Fvwm : Don't Try This at Home
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-fvwm.jpg) <br />
I recommend You to use [Mixed Fvwm Themes](http://www.vakuumverpackt.de/fvwm/) instead. <br />
**Stuff in the screenshot** : Fvwm Pager, Minimized to Thumbnail module (Firefox, GIMP, and Evince), Thunar, vim inside termite, and ncmpcpp. 
I haven't pushed this, too lazy to fix some problem. This WM really drain my patience (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻ <br />
**Now Playing** : Beethoven - Moonlight Sonata <br /> <br />

## Explanations
- **Openbox (Best WM)** <br /> Some useful keybinds like snap window with useless gaps (super + arrows). MPC control using *play/pause, next, previous,* and *stop* keys. 
*Super + number* to switch workspace like in i3wm. *Super + shift + number* to send window to another workspace (also like in i3wm), and more keybinds. 
And a well commented *autostart* file is included. I only put one Openbox theme in this repo. 
My other Openbox themes is in [Openbox Theme Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Openbox-Theme-Collections).

- **Other WMs** <br /> Pretty stock simple setup of i3, herbstluftwm, Bspwm, Fluxbox, Spectrwm, dwm & [xfwm-standalone](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/xfwm4-standalone).

- **.profile and .xsessionrc** <br /> They are scripts those executed by LightDM when You login X session. Previously I use *.profile* file when I'm still on Arch. 
But, I found that *~/.profile* file is not executed by LightDM on Debian.
So, I use *~/.xsessionrc* file now (maybe *.xsessionrc* also work in Arch, I haven't tested it). 
It contains some command to export *~/.bar*, *~/.executor*, *~/.notify*, *~/.utility*, and some other folders to ```$PATH```. 
It's important if You want to use my configurations. Because I centralized most of the command to my ```$PATH```. 
Exporting them to ```$PATH``` make the custom script in those folders can be launched without writing the absolute path. 
For example to launch Rofi, I just need to make a keybind to execute ```rofi-apps```, instead of ```/home/addy/.utilty/rofi-apps```.

- **Rofi (Best Launcher)** <br /> My Rofi looks like this <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-rofi.jpg) <br /> 
My rofi colour is set in *~/.Xresources*, but it just an #INCLUDE command. The actual colour configuration is in *~/.xrdb/rofi*, You will understand if You look at it. 
And the launch configuration is in *~/.utility/rofi-apps*. If You use my *.profile* or *.xsessionrc*, just make a keybind to execute ```rofi-apps``` to make your Rofi launched with appearance like this. <br /> <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-rofi2.jpg) <br /> 
That's my rofi with dark colour. <br /> 

- **obmenu-generator** <br /> My Openbox menu is generated using obmenu-generator pipemenu. 
To use my scheme simply copy my scheme & config, then install *obmenu-generator* from AUR and type ```obmenu-generator -p``` and reconfigure Openbox.
My menu scheme looks like this (result may vary) <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-obmenu.jpg) <br /> 
**Now Playing** : Dream Theater - A Change of Seasons <br />

- **Neofetch** Just simple neofetch configuration. I made a shortcut called ```fetch``` to launch Neofetch with custom colour and logo. <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-neofetch.jpg) <br /> 
When the colour accent of my theme is cyan I launch ```fetch -cyan```. <br /> <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-neofetch2.jpg) <br /> 
When the colour accent of my theme is froly I launch ```fetch -froly``` :kissing_heart: <br /> 
You need w3m package to display image in terminal.

- **zshrc** <br /> Contains my *oh-my-zsh* config. Including my minimalist oh-my-zsh themes (in ~/.oh-my-zsh folder).
To use it, simply install oh-my-zsh, copy my .zshrc & .oh-my-zsh folder to your home. Then switch shell using ```chsh``` command.
It also contains some useful alias, so please read before use :wink:

- **~/.utility/ytmp3** <br /> Just a helper to download mp3 from Youtube using youtube-dl, use the video title as ID3 metadata, then embed the thumbnail as albumart.
To use it simply run ```ytmp3 <URL>``` for example ```ytmp3 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgNV4Nvetg``` <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-ytmp3.jpg) <br /> <br /> 
But sometimes the thumbnail doesn't look nice, add ```-n``` flag to skip embed the albumart, for example ```ytmp3 -n https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgNV4Nvetg```.
By the way I use Dream Theater (best band) song, [The Bigger Picture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpgNV4Nvetg) for the example above. It's a great song, I recommend You to listen to it. 
The minute 5 to the end is one of the best part of the song ever recorded in human history. It sums up every emotion then unleash it. <br />

- **~/.executor** <br /> A collections of scripts to generate status for tint2 (best panel) executor. 
Example : tint2 in my Openbox screenshoot preview above is using these script to display weather and now-playing.
But You can also use it for Polybar custom script, Lemonbar feeder, dzen2 feeder, Conky execi, or pipe it to Dunst, just use your creativity.
And don't forget to read the script before use.

- **Xresources** <br /> My configuration for URxvt (best terminal), including copy paste support by [Muennich](https://github.com/muennich/urxvt-perls). 
Hit Alt+C to copy, and Alt+V to paste (*xsel* package is needed). 
I put the colour configuration in *~/.xrdb* folder and include it in Xresources using ```#include``` command. 
It makes me able to change or mix the colour scheme for urxvt, dmenu, and rofi easily. You will understand if You look at it.
All of my favourite terminal colour scheme I frequently use on my setup is available in *~/.xrdb/color* folder.

- **Compton** <br /> Eye candy shadow. Also some useful "exclude" to avoid broken compositing.

- **Conky** <br /> Not in this repo. My conky themes spreads everywhere in my other repos, Google Drive, and DeviantArt. 
I have a plan to merge them all to my [Conky Themes Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/conky-theme-collections) repo. But I still don't have enough time to do it now.

- **Tint2 (Best Panel)** <br /> Just a single tint2rc, looks like my Openbox preview above. For my another Tint2 collections please check my [Tint2 Themes Collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/Tint2-Theme-Collections). 
You need tint2 with executor support, and consider to use backported tint2 from BunsenLabs repo if You are on Debian. 
Tint2 version in Debian repo is outdated (Upss, every packages in Debian repo is outdated actually :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: )

- **termite** <br /> My termite terminal emulator configuration with Nord colour scheme & Mostly-Bright colour scheme.

- **ncmpcpp (best music player)** <br /> A simple ncmpcpp config, with album art support. The album art script is taken from [Marco](https://marcocheung.wordpress.com/). 
Slightly modified to get rid the transparency bug. 
To use ncmpcpp with album art, simply launch ```ncmpcpp -c .ncmpcpp/config-art``` or ```ncmpcpp -c .ncmpcpp/config-art-dark``` (make a shortcut for it for easy launch). 
Urxvt with pixbuf enabled is needed. You can get it from AUR, the package name is *rxvt-unicode-pixbuf*. 
For Debian (best distro) user, You don't need, the URxvt in Debian repo is compiled with pixbuf by default.  
Also integrated with *dunst* notification (any notification daemon should be work, but I haven't tested it). Just copy my dunst config, install dunst, and do nothing. 
Dunst will launch automatically if triggered by *notify-send* event (except if You're not using Display Manager, add ```dunst &``` to your ~/.xinitrc). 
And because this is a hacky trick, the album art can't adapt to the terminal size :disappointed_relieved:

- **Skippy-XD** <br /> If You don't know, Skippy-XD is a program to expose the stacked windows. I usually use it when I go taskbar-less. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-skippy.jpg) <br />
My Skippy-XD configuration looks like this, nothing special.

- **Geany** <br /> Contains my configuration & colour scheme for Geany <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-geany.jpg) <br />
My dark colour looks like this. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-geany2.jpg) <br />
And my light colour looks like this.

- **Vim** <br /> Just a simple & plugin-less vimrc. Nothing special here, I'm not an IT guy :pensive:

- **Audacious** <br /> Nothing special here. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-audacious.jpg) <br />
Just a configuration to remove some components of Audacious, to make it looks minimal :yum:

- **gtk.css** <br /> Add useless space wasting paddings (who don't love terminal paddings? it looks nice) for vte-based terminal, including termite & xfce4-terminal.

- **~/.toys** <br /> Boys love toys, so I include some toys I collected from [Crunchbang Forum](https://crunchbang.org/forums/viewtopic.php?id=13645) & Stark's [Color-Scripts](https://github.com/stark/Color-Scripts). <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-toys.jpg) <br />
I frequently use them for terminal colour scheme show-off. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-pokemon.jpg) <br />
Also contains a script to launch URxvt with Pokemon background (URxvt with pixbuf enabled is needed). Use light terminal colour scheme first. It's super effective!

- **~/.notify** <br /> A set of command to pipe my executor scripts to Dunst. When I go statusbar-less, I usually made keybinds to execute them. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-dunst.jpg) <br />
In the screenshot above, I made a keybinds to execute ```notify-weather```, ```notify-music```, and ```notify-ssid```. It displayed as notifications when I hit those keybinds.

- **~/.utility/record** <br /> A script to do a screenrecord using ffmpeg, so You don't need any external program.
You just need ffmpeg and mkv codec, mostly autoinstalled when You have a multimedia player like VLC or MPV. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-screenrecord.jpg) <br />
To use this, launch your rofi and hit Shift + Left to enter *run* mode (if you're using my rofi configuration).
Search ```record``` and hit enter to start recording. If You want to end the recording session, launch your rofi again, hit Shift + Left, search for ```stop-recording``` then hit Enter.
The video will be saved in *~/Videos/record.mkv*. Rename it first before take another recording session :wink:

- **~/.utility/screeny** <br /> A script to take a screenshot using scrot, move the result to *~/Pictures*, then preview the result using Viewnior.
Bind ```screeny``` command to your *Print Screen* button. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-screeny.jpg) <br />
And You can instantly delete the result if You are unsatified the screenshoot using Delete button.

- **Ranger** <br /> Pretty stock Ranger file manager configuration. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-ranger.jpg) <br />
You need w3m package to display image preview in terminal, the recommended terminal is URxvt.

- **Startpage** <br /> My own hardcoded startpage using HTML & CSS. Not a programmer, at least it works I'm quite happy :cry: <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-startpage.jpg) <br />
Mystartpage looks like this. Dark variant is also available.

- **Bar** <br /> My collections of Lemonbar script/config. The workspace indicator is generated using xdotool, so it can be work on any WM.
Except *panel-bspwm*, it's specially designed for Bspwm. The workspace indicator is generated using ```bspc subscribe``` for efficient loop.
The wifi indicator is generated using ```/sbin/iwgetid```, another distro than Debian (best distro) may have different path of ```iwgetid```. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-popup.jpg) <br />
*panel-mini* has a bonus ability. It can display album art popup using mpc, ImageMagick, and n30f. Click left to display popup and click right to close popup.
I put the popup script in *~/.toys* and the background image in *~/.popup* folder.

- **~/.fonts** <br /> Contains Icomoon font, for some of my Polybar config. It's actually packed by NerdyPepper, but I think It would be wise to save a copy here to make You easier to recreate my setup.
Also contains Siji and Tewi fonts. To use those bitmap fonts, add ```xset fp+ ~/.fonts/misc &``` to your startup. 
And maybe You also need to ```sudo dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config``` on Debian to enable the bitmap fonts.

- **Stalonetray** <br /> A configuration file for stalonetray. I usually use it as a companion for Lemonbar. Lemonbar has no dedicated system tray handler.
The system tray will be placed on top-left of the desktop and undocked (like on my Bspwm preview above).

- **Weechat** <br /> Minimalist Weechat IRC config with Bufflist (like in my Bspwm & Xfwm) screenshoot above. 
Unfotunately the Weechat version in Debian repo is too low and doesn't support Bufflist (except by using external plugin). 
My config also contains some useful alias to hide/unhide nicklist and time.

- **Plank** <br /> Minimalist Plank theme looks like in my Rofi preview screenshot above.

- **~/.utility/gitpush & ~/.utility/gitsetup** <br /> A helper script made by Erik Dubois to push files to GitHub repository.

## Comments
Most of the configurations are well-commented. Make sure You read them.

## Tips & Tricks
Some tricks I frequently use for my wallpaper. Ssssstttt these are secret :wink: <br />

- **Linear Vignette** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips1.jpg) <br /> 
Use your terminal background & foreground colour as background & foreground colour in your GIMP toolbox. Then create new layer using background colour. 
Add black layer mask, select gradient tool in the toolbox then drag your mouse from top left to bottom right in the image. Reduce the opacity. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result1.jpg) <br />
Now my conky looks nice in the dark side of wallpaper :blush: <br />

- **Radial Vignette** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips2.jpg) <br /> 
Use your terminal background & foreground colour as background & foreground colour in your GIMP toolbox. Then create new layer using background colour. 
Add white layer mask, switch background & foreground colour in the toolbox, select the gradient tool but set it as radial gradient (top right dock). 
Then drag your mouse from center to the outer left or right side of the image and reduce the opacity. You should have a vignette effect now. 
But let's go more advanced. My panel has purple accent colour, so I create new purple layer to make my wallpaper matches with my panel. I reduce the opacity to 10%. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/preview-fluxbox.jpg) <br />
Now my setup blends well with the wallpaper :relaxed: <br />

- **Out of Focus** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips3.jpg) <br /> 
Duplicate your layer then apply gaussian blur effect (Filter > Blur > Gaussian Blur) with 50% radius on the top layer. 
Then add white layer mask. Select gradient tool (use radial gradient like guide above). 
Switch background & foreground colour in your toolbox then drag your mouse from center to the outer left or right side of the image. 
You should have an out of focus effect now. But, the image still too bright. So, Let's dim it. 
add new layer with background colour (the dark one), then reduce the opacity. <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result3.jpg) <br />
This is my old screenshot, so not very accurate. Just for example. <br />

- **Vintage** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips4.jpg) <br /> 
Simply just increase the brightness and reduce the contrast. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result4.jpg) <br />
Hmmmm.. Looks nice with pywal apparently :smirk: <br />

- **Think Out of The Box** <br /> 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips-result2.jpg) <br /> 
I already have a line shaped workspace indicator. So, I only need a static icons for workspace icons. <br /> <br />
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/addy-dclxvi/almighty-dotfiles/master/tips5.jpg) <br />
So, I glued the icons to the wallpaper using GIMP :joy: <br />
If it looks stupid but it works, it's not stupid :laughing:
